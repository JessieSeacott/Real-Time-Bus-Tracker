Real Time Bus Tracker

Project description:
This project shows the bus stops on the route from Traverse City, Michigan, to Detroit, Michigan.
Originally this project was an assignment from Dr. Sanchez, finishing the javascript to show the bus 
stops from MIT's campus to Harvard's campus in Cambridge, Massachusetts. From there, I changed the
style of the map, from a traditional road map to a satalite scan and masked over all counrties but
America with a slightly transparent white cover. I also changed the route to traveling to Detroit from 
Traverse City using data from Greyhound's website. I chose to skip stops that were within the same
city as previous stops. 

How to run:
this project is meant to run on a web browser. To run this project yourself, save all of its files in 
a single location on your machine. Next drag and drop the "index.html" file onto your web browser, 
Google Chrome recommended. Now the program is operational and you can click the button to run the 
route.

Roadmap for improvements:
I would like to make this project run smoother by making the button run the code again without need to 
refresh the page. Another improvement would be to show the route and have the marker slide along the 
route, pausing at the stops before continuing on.
